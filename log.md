# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Round 2:

### Day 1: January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Lesson: Build Chatbots with Python on Codecademy, finished Echo Chatbot project. Began review of Learn Python 3 finishing the whole Functions section and did part of the Control Flow section. Began review of Basic HTML and HTML5 section of freeCodeCamp from beginning to Create a Set of Checkboxes. Also, went to the [Google x CUNY Community College Workshop Series / UX Research], since I got accepted into the [Queensborough Community College/CUNY TechWorks Software Engineering Development Program](http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/contEd/CUNY-TechWorks.html) which I began in July, 2019. This was at the Google office at 75 9th Avenue Second Floor, Room: Atlantic City, New York, NY. Worked on a UX project with a team for an app idea where pets are paired up with users seeking therapy. Working name: Kitty Therapy.

**Thoughts:** Had a very productive day. Trying to grow into a full stack web developer and data scientist with a primary focus on Machine Learning, AI and the financial sector. So, right now I am really focussing my efforts on learning Python 3 as my primary language within the data science field. I want to polish up syntax, control flow, functions and loops.

### Day 2: January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work in Build Chatbots with Python on Codecademy, finished the whole Part 1: Introduction to Python and Chatbots and completed the Coffee Chatbot project that a user can interact with to order coffee from a cafe. 

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel and get the workflow better of modularization of creating functions with control flow. Then putting functions inside of functions. Also, getting input from the user and bring it altogether in a more comprehensive function such as the Coffee Chatbot for ordering coffee with various options from the user and interaction.

### Day 3: January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work in Data Science Career Path on Codecademy, finished the whole Part 1: The Importance of Data and SQL Basics, Introduction to SQL and completed the Create a Table project with SQL.

**Thoughts:** Learned more about Data Science and the basic concepts behind it. Getting a better feeling how SQL, databases, Python and Statisctics fit together as tools and what a Data Scientist does.

### Day 4: January 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Decided to redo work I did in Build Websites from Scratch Pro Intensive that Codecademy used to offer and I took from December 19, 2017 to March 17, 2018. I was a newbie at that time, and I fizzled out toward the end and didn't get my certificate by the March 17th deadline. I did a poor job of the final capstone project, Colmar Academy and I didn't complete the last Unit 9: Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery, only doing up to part of the jQuery section. Today, I redid the Flexbox lesson in Unit 4: Display and Positioning. Since I am a Pro Member in Codecademy, I intend as part of my 100 Days of Code Challenge to work on completing this Pro Intensive and requesting my certificate from Codecademy. Also, I checked out a YouTube video by Brad Traversy of Traversy Media, "Flexbox CSS in 20 Minutes." That was really helpful as Brad is a great teacher!

**Thoughts:** Had a difficult time the first time around with Flexbox, but I feel better the 2nd time around. Although, it is still a challenge to a degree. The Brad Traversy video helped out in clarifying things.

### Day 5: January 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work in Build Chatbots with Python on Codecademy, Starting Part 2: Python Data Structures and Loops. Did work on Python lists, completing 2 Lessons, Creating and Modifying a List in Python and Working with Lists in Python. Finished 2 Projects, Python Gradebook and Len's Slice. Completed a Quiz, Working with Lists in Python, and started the Code Challenge on Lists. 

**Thoughts:** Getting a better grasp on slicing and lists in general with various methods like len(), range(), sort(), etc.

### Day 6: January 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work in Build Chatbots with Python on Codecademy, completing the Code Challenge on Lists. 

**Thoughts:** Struggled through the Code Challenge and had to look at some solutions and hints and think my way through them. But then I was able to get some of the functions and I feel like I grew. Comparing lists with conditionals, using the sort() and range() functions. Getting a better understanding.
