# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Round 2:

### Day 1: January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Lesson: Build Chatbots with Python on Codecademy, finished Echo Chatbot project. Began review of Learn Python 3 finishing the whole Functions section and did part of the Control Flow section. Began review of Basic HTML and HTML5 section of freeCodeCamp from beginning to Create a Set of Checkboxes. Also, went to the [Google x CUNY Community College Workshop Series / UX Research], since I got accepted into the [Queensborough Community College/CUNY TechWorks Software Engineering Development Program](http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/contEd/CUNY-TechWorks.html) which I began in July, 2019. This was at the Google office at 75 9th Avenue Second Floor, Room: Atlantic City, New York, NY. Worked on a UX project with a team for an app idea where pets are paired up with users seeking therapy. Working name: Kitty Therapy.

**Thoughts:** Had a very productive day. Trying to grow into a full stack web developer and data scientist with a primary focus on Machine Learning, AI and the financial sector. So, right now I am really focussing my efforts on learning Python 3 as my primary language within the data science field. I want to polish up syntax, control flow, functions and loops.

### Day 2: January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work in Build Chatbots with Python on Codecademy, finished the whole Part 1: Introduction to Python and Chatbots and completed the Coffee Chatbot project that a user can interact with to order coffee from a cafe. 

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel and get the workflow better of modularization of creating functions with control flow. Then putting functions inside of functions. Also, getting input from the user and bring it altogether in a more comprehensive function such as the Coffee Chatbot for ordering coffee with various options from the user and interaction.

### Day 3: January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work in Data Science Career Path on Codecademy, finished the whole Part 1: The Importance of Data and SQL Basics, Introduction to SQL and completed the Create a Table project with SQL.

**Thoughts:** Learned more about Data Science and the basic concepts behind it. Getting a better feeling how SQL, databases, Python and Statisctics fit together as tools and what a Data Scientist does.

### Day 4: January 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Decided to redo work I did in Build Websites from Scratch Pro Intensive that Codecademy used to offer and I took from December 19, 2017 to March 17, 2018. I was a newbie at that time, and I fizzled out toward the end and didn't get my certificate by the March 17th deadline. I did a poor job of the final capstone project, Colmar Academy and I didn't complete the last Unit 9: Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery, only doing up to part of the jQuery section. Today, I redid the Flexbox lesson in Unit 4: Display and Positioning. Since I am a Pro Member in Codecademy, I intend as part of my 100 Days of Code Challenge to work on completing this Pro Intensive and requesting my certificate from Codecademy. Also, I checked out a YouTube video by Brad Traversy of Traversy Media, "Flexbox CSS in 20 Minutes." That was really helpful as Brad is a great teacher!

**Thoughts:** Had a difficult time the first time around with Flexbox, but I feel better the 2nd time around. Although, it is still a challenge to a degree. The Brad Traversy video helped out in clarifying things.

### Day 5: January 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work in Build Chatbots with Python on Codecademy, Starting Part 2: Python Data Structures and Loops. Did work on Python lists, completing 2 Lessons, Creating and Modifying a List in Python and Working with Lists in Python. Finished 2 Projects, Python Gradebook and Len's Slice. Completed a Quiz, Working with Lists in Python, and started the Code Challenge on Lists. 

**Thoughts:** Getting a better grasp on slicing and lists in general with various methods like len(), range(), sort(), etc.

### Day 6: January 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work in Build Chatbots with Python on Codecademy, completing the Code Challenge on Lists. 

**Thoughts:** Struggled through the Code Challenge and had to look at some solutions and hints and think my way through them. But then I was able to get some of the functions and I feel like I grew. Comparing lists with conditionals, using the sort() and range() functions. Getting a better understanding.

### Day 7: January 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work in Build Chatbots with Python on Codecademy, Part 2: Python Data Structures and Loops. Watched video on tuples, coding along in the z shell, completed lesson and quiz on loops. Finished the Looping Coffee Chatbot project. Also, went to the [Codecademy NYC Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/NYC-Codecademy-Group/events/267449751/). Mingled with other Codecademy Learners and vibed with the hospitable Codecademy staff. Special thanks to Alyssa Vigil, community manager at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). Got majority part of my day's work done at the meetup. 

**Thoughts:** Had a productive day. Better grasp on loops in Python and then applying the concepts on the Coffee Chatbot project was great.

### Day 8: January 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work in Build Chatbots with Python on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), Part 2: Python Data Structures and Loops. Did work with Python Dictionaries today. Completed 2 Lessons: Creating Dictionaries and Using Dictionaries, Quiz: Using Dictionaries. Completed the Scrabble project. Also, did work in Learn Python 3 on Codecademy, Part 7: Modules. Completed 1 Lesson, Modules: Python, watched a video, Datetimes and coded along in the z shell. Started to watch and code along in z shell and VS Code for Pipenv.

**Thoughts:** Wrapping my mind around Python Dictionaries. I understand them, especially the key:value pairs and some advantages. However, it is going to take me at least another round or 2 to get the basics down before I move on. Also, wrapping my mind around virtual environments in Python in addition to the Datetime library.

### Day 9: January 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Had a review day on [Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/) Learn Python 3: Part 6, Strings. No sense in rushing through. I have to get this foundation down. Also, finished Part 7: Modules, the Pipenv part. Coded along in the z shell. Now I understand virtual environment and case uses when you need to have different libraries and packages for different projects without messing with your basic system, but have unique virtual ones. Getting better with the shell and commands.

**Thoughts:** The more I work the foundational things such as these strings in Python, the better I feel with them. Feel enriched after working with virtual environments in Python's pipenv.

### Day 10: January 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/) Learn Python 3: Censor Dispenser project. Finally, figured out how to get the 'learning', 'algorithms' strings not to be in the email_one.txt file. Tomorrow, got to write the function.

**Thoughts:** These type of projects and challenges are good because they force me to put my thinking cap on and try different things, experimenting and thinking pieces through on the way to putting it altogether toward a bigger goal. Functions, methods, loops, lists, strings, control flow with conditionals and other concepts put together to solve a bigger problem. This is good and I feel like I am growing through the struggle especially when it doesn't work out at first but I have my eureka moments!

### Day 11: January 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began [Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/) Create a Front-End App with React Skill Path. Worked on JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension) concept and syntax. Did some JavaScript review and studied a new part for me on JavaScript Modules in Part 4: Modern JavaScript: Modules and Browser Compatibility.

**Thoughts:** Wrapping my mind around React.js. From my understanding so far, it is a JavaScript library. It's weird how JS and HTML are combined into a new and different construct. Also, I love the concept of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and SRP (Single Responsibility Principle). This is related to having separate files and modularization and their purposes. Not to mention cleaner and more efficient code. A light bulb is starting to come on in my mind. Yes!

### Day 12: January 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued on [Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/) Create a Front-End App with React Skill Path. Completed 4 Lessons: Intro to JSX, Advanced JSX, Your First React Component, Components and Advanced JSX; 2 Quizzes: JSX, React Components (100%s). Completed the Authorization Form project. Read and followed along with an interactive article, Creating a React App. I downloaded my first React app via npm and the z shell. Opened it in my local :3000 server. Read another article on Informational React Developer Tools and installed a Chrome extension for React Dev Tools. Started work locally on the Ravenous project, Part 1, Create Project and Components via the z shell in my Terminal and the Atom editor.

**Thoughts:** Had a very productive day! Made great strides with React. My mind is blown in a positive way. Getting the hang of the React syntax with JSX. How to start a React project from scratch with node and npm. Some of the concepts and skills that I have been accumulating since I started my Programming Journey since late 2017 are starting to come together nicely in my mind. I am super psyched. It continues!

### Day 13: January 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued on [Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/) Create a Front-End App with React Skill Path. Completed 2 Lessons in Part 6: React: Components Interacting, Components Render Other Components, this.props. Worked some more on the Ravenous project, Part 1. Also, started the spring semester at the [Queensborough Community College / CUNY TechWorks - Software Development Program](CUNY TechWorks - Software Development Program). The class, Introduction to C++ Programming Design and Implementation teaches C++ and Programming concepts and projects. Today, we worked on creating C++ files in the command line on a Windows system, then compiling and running them in the command line.

**Thoughts:** Going further in React. Learned about props and event handlers such as buttons triggering functions within components and how componenets can be linked up between files through import and export. Objects, conditionals and arrays came into play. It is all coming together by degrees.
