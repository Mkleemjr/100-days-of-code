# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Round 2:

### Day 1: January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Lesson: Build Chatbots with Python on Codecademy, finished Echo Chatbot project. Began review of Learn Python 3 finishing the whole Functions section and did part of the Control Flow section. Began review of Basic HTML and HTML5 section of freeCodeCamp from beginning to Create a Set of Checkboxes. Also, went to the [Google x CUNY Community College Workshop Series / UX Research], since I got accepted into the [Queensborough Community College/CUNY TechWorks Software Engineering Development Program](http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/contEd/CUNY-TechWorks.html) which I began in July, 2019. This was at the Google office at 75 9th Avenue Second Floor, Room: Atlantic City, New York, NY. Worked on a UX project with a team for an app idea where pets are paired up with users seeking therapy. Working name: Kitty Therapy.

**Thoughts:** Had a very productive day. Trying to grow into a full stack web developer and data scientist with a primary focus on Machine Learning, AI and the financial sector. So, right now I am really focussing my efforts on learning Python 3 as my primary language within the data science field. I want to polish up syntax, control flow, functions and loops.

### Day 4: January 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Decided to redo work I did in Build Websites from Scratch Pro Intensive that Codecademy used to offer and I took from December 19, 2017 to March 17, 2018. I was a newbie at that time, and I fizzled out toward the end and didn't get my certificate by the March 17th deadline. I did a poor job of the final capstone project, Colmar Academy and I didn't complete the last Unit 9: Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery, only doing up to part of the jQuery section. Today, I redid the Flexbox lesson in Unit 4: Display and Positioning. Since I am a Pro Member in Codecademy, I intend as part of my 100 Days of Code Challenge to work on completing this Pro Intensive and requesting my certificate from Codecademy. Also, I checked out a YouTube video by Brad Traversy of Traversy Media, "Flexbox CSS in 20 Minutes." That was really helpful as Brad is a great teacher!

**Thoughts:** Had a difficult time the first time around with Flexbox, but I feel better the 2nd time around. Although, it is still a challenge to a degree. The Brad Traversy video helped out in clarifying things.

### Day 6: January 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work in Build Chatbots with Python on Codecademy, completing the Code Challenge on Lists. Also went on reactjs.org and studied Components and Props.

**Thoughts:** Struggled through the Code Challenge and had to look at some solutions and hints and think my way through them. But then I was able to get some of the functions and I feel like I grew. Comparing lists with conditionals, using the sort() and range() functions. Getting a better understanding.

### Day 8: January 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work in Build Chatbots with Python on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), Part 2: Python Data Structures and Loops. Did work with Python Dictionaries today. Completed 2 Lessons: Creating Dictionaries and Using Dictionaries, Quiz: Using Dictionaries. Completed the Scrabble project. Also, did work in Learn Python 3 on Codecademy, Part 7: Modules. Completed 1 Lesson, Modules: Python, watched a video, Datetimes and coded along in the z shell. Started to watch and code along in z shell and VS Code for Pipenv.

**Thoughts:** Wrapping my mind around Python Dictionaries. I understand them, especially the key:value pairs and some advantages. However, it is going to take me at least another round or 2 to get the basics down before I move on. Also, wrapping my mind around virtual environments in Python in addition to the Datetime library.

### Day 9: January 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Had a review day on [Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/) Learn Python 3: Part 6, Strings. No sense in rushing through. I have to get this foundation down. Also, finished Part 7: Modules, the Pipenv part. Coded along in the z shell. Now I understand virtual environment and case uses when you need to have different libraries and packages for different projects without messing with your basic system, but have unique virtual ones. Getting better with the shell and commands.

**Thoughts:** The more I work the foundational things such as these strings in Python, the better I feel with them. Feel enriched after working with virtual environments in Python's pipenv.

### Day 10: January 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/) Learn Python 3: Censor Dispenser project. Finally, figured out how to get the 'learning', 'algorithms' strings not to be in the email_one.txt file. Tomorrow, got to write the function.

**Thoughts:** These type of projects and challenges are good because they force me to put my thinking cap on and try different things, experimenting and thinking pieces through on the way to putting it altogether toward a bigger goal. Functions, methods, loops, lists, strings, control flow with conditionals and other concepts put together to solve a bigger problem. This is good and I feel like I am growing through the struggle especially when it doesn't work out at first but I have my eureka moments!

### Day 11: January 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began [Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/) Create a Front-End App with React Skill Path. Worked on JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension) concept and syntax. Did some JavaScript review and studied a new part for me on JavaScript Modules in Part 4: Modern JavaScript: Modules and Browser Compatibility.

**Thoughts:** Wrapping my mind around React.js. From my understanding so far, it is a JavaScript library. It's weird how JS and HTML are combined into a new and different construct. Also, I love the concept of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and SRP (Single Responsibility Principle). This is related to having separate files and modularization and their purposes. Not to mention cleaner and more efficient code. A light bulb is starting to come on in my mind. Yes!

Read and followed along with an interactive article, Creating a React App. I downloaded my first React app via npm and the z shell. Opened it in my local :3000 server. Read another article on Informational React Developer Tools and installed a Chrome extension for React Dev Tools. Started work locally on the Ravenous project, Part 1, Create Project and Components via the z shell in my Terminal and the Atom editor.

**Thoughts:** Had a very productive day! Made great strides with React. My mind is blown in a positive way. Getting the hang of the React syntax with JSX. How to start a React project from scratch with node and npm. Some of the concepts and skills that I have been accumulating since I started my Programming Journey since late 2017 are starting to come together nicely in my mind. I am super psyched. It continues!

Starting learning how to set up a Cordova project through the Terminal with Node.js and NPM in my Creating Smartphone Apps class at QCC TechWorks.

**Thoughts:** Had a productive day both on Codecademy and at my school program. Learning a new technology, Cordova and its framework. Very psyched. 

**Link(s) to work:** [Mini Linter](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-web-apps-with-react/tracks/bwa-javascript-iterators-objects-and-classes/modules/learn-javascript-iterators/projects/mini-linter)

### Day 24: February 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked in [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn). Completed the Objects and Advanced Objects Lessons within the Create a Front-End App with React Skill Path. Learned about things like getters and setters, factory functions, this key word, iterating through objects, nested objects, destructuring. Key and value pairs. Creating a type of object and then mass producing custom objects from that prototype.

**Thoughts:** Objects are powerful concepts. On my way to Object Oriented Programming. I feel empowered. 

**Link(s) to work:** [Objects](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-web-apps-with-react/tracks/bwa-javascript-iterators-objects-and-classes/modules/learn-javascript-objects/lessons/objects/exercises/nested-objects) | [Advanced Objects](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-web-apps-with-react/tracks/bwa-javascript-iterators-objects-and-classes/modules/learn-javascript-objects/lessons/advanced-objects/exercises/object-methods)

### Day 25: February 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked in [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn). Started the Classes section in Create a Front-End App with React Skill Path. Got through Constructors, Instances, Methods, Method Calls. Began working with Inheritance. 

**Thoughts:** Object Oriented Programming is a powerful concept. This way you don't have to start from scratch every time. You can define an object and its properties and methods. Then you can add unique properties and methods that further refine an object and this is where classes come in. Types of objects. Then multiple or scalable groups of objects can be created depending on what you are creating. Can't wait to dive deeper.
