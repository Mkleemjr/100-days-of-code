# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Round 2:

### Day 1: January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Lesson: Build Chatbots with Python on Codecademy, finished Echo Chatbot project. Began review of Learn Python 3 finishing the whole Functions section and did part of the Control Flow section. Began review of Basic HTML and HTML5 section of freeCodeCamp from beginning to Create a Set of Checkboxes. Also, went to the [Google x CUNY Community College Workshop Series / UX Research], since I got accepted into the [Queensborough Community College/CUNY TechWorks Software Engineering Development Program](http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/contEd/CUNY-TechWorks.html) which I began in July, 2019. This was at the Google office at 75 9th Avenue Second Floor, Room: Atlantic City, New York, NY. Worked on a UX project with a team for an app idea where pets are paired up with users seeking therapy. Working name: Kitty Therapy.

**Thoughts:** Had a very productive day. Trying to grow into a full stack web developer and data scientist with a primary focus on Machine Learning, AI and the financial sector. So, right now I am really focussing my efforts on learning Python 3 as my primary language within the data science field. I want to polish up syntax, control flow, functions and loops.

### Day 2: January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Build Chatbots with Python on Codecademy, finished the whole Part 1: Introduction to Python and Chatbots and completed the Coffee Chatbot project that a user can interact with to order coffee from a cafe. 

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel and get the workflow better of modularization of creating functions with control flow. Then putting functions inside of functions. Also, getting input from the user and bring it altogether in a more comprehensive function such as the Coffee Chatbot for ordering coffee with various options from the user and interaction.
